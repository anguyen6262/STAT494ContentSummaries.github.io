        <h2>Key Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Genetic basis: the extent of variance in an individual at risk for contracting a common disease based on heredity.
                Morbidity: suffering from a medical condition.
                Genotyping: process of determining DNA sequence. This process helps scientists see genetic variations.
                Aetiologies: cause of disease.
                Allelic architecture:# of distinct alleles that affect the likelihood of contracting a disease at a disease locus(location of a specific gene) and their frequencies.
                Phenotyping: process of determining, analyzing, and predicting phenotypes.
                Allele frequency: Calculated by dividing the # of times the allele of interest is observed by the total number of alleles at that locus.
                Linkage: Closeness of genes or other DNA sequences to one another on the same chromosome.
                Linkage Disequilibrium: non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population.
                Covariates: independent variables that can affect outcome of trial.
                Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNP): genomic variant at a single base position in DNA.
                Pathological: caused or altered by disease.

                    The following study was written in 2007 and is still referenced today in the field of genetic Statistics. 
                    They sampled Caucuasian people in Europe. The reasoning for this sample is because it is easier to test 
                    people that are genetically similar. This can be controversial because the data and results can't be accuratly
                    applied to people with different ethnic backgrounds. The dataset is used for future studies because it is more cost effective to reuse datasets rather than 
                    collect new samples. They focused on seven different diseases and tested whether or not they were associated
                    with a SNPs. Descriptions of the seven diseases can be found below. <span><a href="">this</a></span>

        <label>Diseases Explored</label>
            <ul>
                <li>Bipolar disorder : Episodes of extreme changes in mood, energy level, motivation, and interests.</li>
                <li>Coronary artery disease : damage or disease in the heart's blood vessels which can lead to heart attacks or chest pain.</li>
                <li>Crohn’s disease : Bowel disease that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
                </li>
                <li>Hypertension : High blood pressure. Can lead to heart disease or strokes.</li>
                <li>Rheumatoid arthritis : Body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. Symptoms include swelling or inflammation of joints.</li>
                <li>Type 1 Diabetes: diagnosed in childhood. Symptoms include thirst, hunger, and fatigue. The body doesn’t produce enough insulin.</li>
                <li>Type 2 Diabetes: diagnosed in adult years. Symptoms include thirst, hunger, and fatigue. The body doesn’t produce enough insulin.</li>
                Pellagra: A disease whose symptoms are dementia and diarrhea. Caused by a lack of vitamin B-3.
                Tuberculosis: A bacterial disease that affects the lungs.
                Leprosy: Infectious disease that affects skin, peripheral nerves, and eyes.

                Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA): neurotransmitter that slows down your brain by blocking signals in the central nervous system.
                atheromatous plaques: hardening of arteries due to accumulation of plaque.
                angina pectoris: severe chest pain that can lead to neck and shoulder. Caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart. Is a symptom of CAD
                myocardial infarction: Heart Attack. Severe heart pain from lack of blood flow.
                Hypertension: High blood pressure.

                Enzyme: Proteins that help speed up metabolism.
                Autophagy: degradation of a cell which is the body's way of removing unnecessary or dysfunctional components of a cell.
                misclassification bias: Participant is put into the wrong category which alters results.
