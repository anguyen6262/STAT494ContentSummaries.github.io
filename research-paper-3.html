    <h1>Genes mirror geography within Europe</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>To see whether or not it was possible to determine an individual's geographic origin 
        based on their genome.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
    </section>
  <p>
    The researcher’s sample consisted of approximately 6,000 individuals and was collected from 
    two collections. If a test subject was non-European they were not considered in the study. 
    Each individual’s geographic origin was classified by their grandparent’s originating country.
      If grandparents originated from different countries,  the individual was excluded. Otherwise
       that country was used as the origin. If information on the grandparents was unavailable,  
       the individual's country of birth was used. Other key notes about the sample is that the 
       sample does not include smaller genetically isolated populations such as Basque or Orcadians.
        Large groups such as Swiss were split into categories such as Swiss-French, Swiss-German, 
        Swiss-Italian. They were divided into these categories based on their primary language 
        rather than their location. At the end of this quality control there were approximately
         1,400 individuals left in the sample. Afterwards the researchers conducted a PCA, spatial 
         assignments, and GWAS simulations.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        
        <p>
            The plot below is a stacked bar plot that describes the accuracy of correctly
            determining a person's country of origin. The distance starts from the central point of 
            each geographical feature. The central points are determined by a linear model 
            predicted by the PC1 and PC2 scores. The only geographical features that didn’t use 
            this model are the Russian Federation, Norway, and Sweden. The capitals were used 
            instead.The column on the left side displays the average of the proportions across the 
            populations at which each population has equal weight. According to this graph the 
            model was least accurate in predicting people from Sweden and Romania. The accuracy 
            could have potentially been affected by outliers which are likely due to small
            sample sizes, but could also be from classifying individuals by 
            their grandparent's originating country. This classification can be misleading. Perhaps parental origins, 
            language, or birth country can be better ways to classify individuals. For example some individuals may have 
            grandparents from Italy, but the individual was born in France, speaks French, and is 
            surrounded by French people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking at this PCA we can see that a person that identified oneself as Russian was
            plotted in Italy. This error could have possibly been caused by the individual misspecifying their ancestor’s origins or perhaps the individual was a recent migrant. Another possibility is that the sample size was too small. For example this study only had one person identified as Slovakian.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>This research is ineffective for people that are mixed or non-European. Also NP 
            genotyping platforms under-represent variation at low-frequency alleles which causes 
            loss of information about the population structure. Also the researcher’s spread 
            their supplementary information across multiple papers which makes it more difficult 
            for readers to understand their analysis.
