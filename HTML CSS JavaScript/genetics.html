    </div> Key Definitions

    <ul>
        <li>Gene: A sequence of DNA molecules.</li>
        <li>Genetics: A branch of biology that studies heredity and genetic variation.</li>
        <li>Heredity: Passing down traits (ex:black,blue,short,tall) or character(ex: eye color/ height) from parents to offspring.</li>
        <li>Homozygous: Same set of genes. Both dominant or both recessive.</li>
        <li>Heterozygous: Different set of genes. Has both dominant and recessive alleles.</li>
        <li>Recessive traits are only expressed when both alleles are recessive. If one allele is dominant then the dominant trait will be expressed.</li>
        <li>Pure Lines: Offsprings obtained after inbreeding for several generations.</li>
        <li>Phenotypes: Features that can be observed externally. (ex: tall height)</li>
        <li>Genotypes: Genetic make up that can’t be observed. Can’t tell if being is homozygous or heterozygous for a character. Also can be thought of as set of genes for a particular trait. (ex:TT / Tt)</li>
        <li>Phenotypic Ratio: (Tall : short)</li>
        <li>Genotypic Ratio: (TT: Tt: tt)</li>
        <li>Allele: forms of a gene found at the same place on a chromosome.</li>
        <li>Allele frequency: Calculated by dividing the # of times the allele of interest is observed by the total number of alleles at that locus.        </li>
        <li>Linkage Disequilibrium: non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population.</li>
        <li>Covariates: independent variables that can affect outcome of trial. </li>
        <li>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNP): genomic variant at a single base position in DNA.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>    

    Thread-like structures in the nucleus are called chromatids. Chromatids are tangled and chromosomes are coiled chromatids in the process of cell division. Chomatids and chromosomes are the same thing, but are different names for different structures.
    Chromosomes are composed of segments called genes.
    Genes are composed of DNA molecules.
