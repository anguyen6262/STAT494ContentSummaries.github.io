    <h1>Genes mirror geography within Europe</h1>
  <p>
    If both grandparents originated from a single country, that country was used as the origin. If grandparents originated from different countries, then the individual was excluded. If info on grandparents was unavailable, then the individuals country of birth was used.
Sample does not include smaller genetically isolated populations such as basque or Orcadians. Large groups such as Swiss where split into categories such as Swiss-French, Swiss-German, Swiss-Italian. They were divided into these categories based on their primary language rather than their location.

            The graph on this slide is a stacked bar plot that describes the accuracy of correctly
            determining a person's country of origin. The distance is from the central point from 
            each geographical feature. The central points are determined by a linear model 
            predicted by the PC1 and PC2 scores. The only geographical features that didnâ€™t use 
            this model are the Russian Federation, Norway, and Sweden. The capitals were used 
            instead.The column on the side displays the average of the proportions across the 
            populations at which each population has equal weight. According to this graph the 
            model was least accurate in predicting people from Sweden and Romania. The accuracy 
            could have potentially been affected because of outliers which are likely due to small
            sample sizes, but could also be because classifying individuals by the ancestry of 
            their grandparents might be misleading. Parental origins, language, or birth country 
            may be better ways to classify individuals. For example some individuals may have 
            grandparents from Italy, but the individual was born in France, speaks French, and is 
            surrounded by French people
