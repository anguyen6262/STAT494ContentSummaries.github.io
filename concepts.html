        <h2>Hypothesis Tests</h2> 
        <p>
            Hypothesis tests are a tool for statistical inference. Statistical inference is 
            judging a population's statistical relationship while taking into account uncertainty
             and sampling variability. Hypothesis tests are used to see if there is a relationship
              between two variables. How hypothesis testing is conducted is by creating a null 
              hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that there is no 
              relationship between the variables and is often denoted as H<sub>0</sub>. On the 
              other hand the alternative hypothesis states that there is a relationship between 
              the variables and is denoted H<sub>A</sub>. Then we compute test statistics. The 
              formula for a test statistic is the following: 
        </p>
            <pre></pre>
            <span class="center">Test statistic = (estimate - null value) / standard error of estimate </span> 
            <pre></pre>
        <p>
            Test statistics essentially tells us how far our estimates are from the null value. 
            Meaning that the larger the test statistic the more likely we are to reject the null 
            hypothesis. Rejecting the null hypothesis means that we are more inclined to believe 
            that there is an association between the variables. How large should test statistics 
            be for us to reject the null hypothesis? That’s when we use a tool called p-values.   
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>P-Value</h2>
        <p>
            A p-value is the probability of producing an estimate farther from the hypothesized 
            value assuming that the null hypothesis were true. P-values are an important tool 
            because they take into account sampling variation. If we have a large test statistic 
            then we have a low p-value and vice versa. The industry uses a significance level
            (&#945;) of 0.05. If the p-value is less than the significance level we can reject the
            null hypothesis.  
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Type Errors</h2>
        <p>Sometimes there are errors in our hypothesis tests. We can split these errors into 
            two categories, type 1 errors and type 2 errors. A type 1 error is rejecting the null
             hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. This can be thought more of as a false 
             positive. A type 2 error is not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
              is false. This is a false negative. If we reduce the significance level, rejecting 
              the null hypothesis would be more difficult which would increase the chances of type
               1 errors and decrease the chance of type 2 errors.

        <h2>Family-Wise Error Rate (FWAS)</h2>
        <p>
            FWER is the probability of getting at least one type 1 error. The formula to calculate 
            the FWER is the following:
        </p>
            <pre></pre>
            <span class="center">FWER = 1 - (1-&#945;)^n</span>
            <pre></pre>
        <p>
            &#945; refers to the significance level and n is the number of tests. Then we adjust for 
            multiple testing with Bonferroni correction. We calculate a new significance threshold by 
            dividing our FWER by the number of hypothesis tests. It's easy to use but can be overly 
            convervative if tests are not independent. However Bonferroni correction will lead to an     
        </p>
            
            excess of type 2 errors.
        </p>
