            <h1>The Genetic Ancestry of African Americans,
                Latinos, and European Americans Across the
                United States</h1>
            <section>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                To research how population admixture affects the relationship between 
                self-reported ancestry and genetic ancestry in different regions. Population admixture refers 
                to when people from different continents or isolated populations interbreed. This research can
                 potentially lead to new treatments and inform medical sciences about conditions found in 
                 certain haplogroups. This may also further research for historians and sociologists.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>For their ancestry analysis the sampled group consisted of 5,269 self-reported African Americans, 
                8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans, who are 23andMe customers. Their geographic analysis
                 sampled group consisted of 1,970 African Americans, 2,944 Latinos, and 45,783 European Americans.
                 This sample is representative of the U.S. because of its reflectiveness of the U.S. 2010 census.
                The customers supplied saliva samples and consented to have their genetic data be used in research.
                 The participants also answered an ancestry survey and an ethnicity survey relating to ethnic 
                 background, current zip code of residency, state of birth, and ancestry. The questions on the 
                 surveys are similar to the questions below:
                
                <div class="survey">

                Only one option can be chosen from this list and those that identified as one of the ethnicities of interest were included in their respective cohort. Participants who self-identified as multiple ethnicities were excluded because including mixed people could potentially cause more outliers in the data. This is acceptable because only a small number of people in the dataset self-identified as multiple ethnicities.
                Self-reports can be unreliable because people consider their ancestry, race, identity, and 
                ethnicity differently based on their traits, culture, and other factors. By checking the consistency 
                between the answers in the two surveys the researchers can enforce the reliability of self-reported 
                ethnicities. However it's important to note that the surveys were taken at different times. This can 
                change the consistency because people may have changed how they perceive their self-identity over 
                time.

                <p>
                    After genotyping the saliva samples of the participants, the researchers began ancestry 
                    composition. They used support vector machines to assign ancestry labels to genomic regions. 
                    Then estimated ancestry proportions and confidence scores at windows of the genome. If the 
                    window’s threshold of 0.51 is surpassed it is included in genome-wide ancestry.
                    For data analysis they estimate time frame of admixture events equation with the 
                    following formula:
                </p>
                    <pre></pre>
                    <img src="equation" >
                    <pre></pre>

                    
                    
                <p>
                    To test how much the male and female contributed to ancestry they minimized the mean
                     square error on the x chromosome. They assumed that the total contribution from each 
                     sex was 50%. Then used grid-search optimization and predicted the x chromosome estimates.

                    To validate their data analysis they checked their population size correlations. Meaning 
                    that used 2010 US Census demographic data to fit linear regression models comparing state 
                    population proportional to the mean estimated admixture proportion of people from that 
                    state. To test the significance of a person’s inferred ancestry and self-reported incestry 
                    they fit a logistic regression model to age, proportion ancestry, sex, age, intercept, and 
                    interaction variables.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <h4>African Americans <span style="font-weight:normal;">(<em>please refer to figure 1 in the article</em>)</span> </h4>
            <p>
                The majority of African Americans with African ancestry are located in southern states, primarily in South Carolina and Georgia. The mean proportion of 
                African ancestry in African Americans is approximately 74.8%. However the relationship between
                 African Americans and Native American ancestry is not as profound. It is estimated that only 
                 22% of African Americans carry Native American ancestry. Oklahoma has the highest proportion 
                 of African Americans carrying Native American ancestry in the U.S. which could be due to 
                 Oklahoma being the place where these populations first interacted. This observation supports
                  the theory that ancestry is reflective of historical migration events.</p>

            <h4>Latinos <span style="font-weight:normal;">(<em>please refer to figure 2 in the article</em>)</span> </h4>
            <p>
                According to the data, Latinos in the U.S. on average carry approximately 65.1% European 
                ancestry, 18% Native American ancestry, and 6.2% African ancestry. Southwestern states have
                 the highest estimated levels of self-reported Latinos who carry Native American ancestry. 
                 Whereas, the highest mean levels of Latinos who carry African ancestry were living in or were 
                 born in Southern states, particularly Louisiana.</p>

            <h4>Europeans <span style="font-weight:normal;">(<em>please refer to figure 3 in the article</em>)</span> </h4>     
            <p>
                Approximately 0.98% of Europeans carry African ancestry and 0.26% of Europeans carry Native 
                American ancestry. Even though the majority of Europeans don’t carry non-european ancestry, 
                the small percentage that do is still millions of individuals. The European Americans who carry
                 Native American ancestry are primarily located west of the Mississippi River. On the other 
                 hand, Europeans with African Ancestry were most likely located at cities with sea ports 
                 relating to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. African American ancestry in European Americans 
                 is strongly correlated with the proportion of population of African Americans in a state. 
                 The higher the proportion the more African ancestry in European Americans.</p>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>One limitation of this study is that the dataset does not provide enough information to make  
                claims about Native American, nor West African ancestry. It’s important to note that this study
                 is inapplicable to mixed race people and Asian people. Another limitation is that 23andMe kits
                  are either $99 or $199 which could discourage low-income people from participating. Also the
                   majority of African Americans surveyed were living or born in California or New York which 
                   could be a result of population density. This is a limitation because African Americans have
                    a lower mean African ancestry than African Americans living in the south. Additionally, sex bias can 
                    potentially skew the results which is due to factors such as exploitation, or more 
                    European men came to the Americas than European women.</p>
