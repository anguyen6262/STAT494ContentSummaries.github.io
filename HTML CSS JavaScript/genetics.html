        <h2>DNA</h2>
        <p>DNA also known as deoxyribo Nucleotide Acid is essentially a blueprint that describles 
            how to create your body. From the color of your eyes to the number of appendages you
            have. In each cell in your body is four molecules called Adenine, Cytosine, Thymine,
            Guanine. These are usually denoted as their respective first letters. These molecules
            will also be referenced as their journals throughout this journal. For example Adenine
            is referenced as A. These DNA molecules are organized into genes. Then these genes form 
            a chromosome. These chromosomes form a thread-like structure in the nucleus called chromatids. 
            Chromatids are tangled and chromosomes are coiled chromatids in the process of cell division. 
            Chomatids and chromosomes are the same thing, but are different names for different structures.
            Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. All cells in a body have a different cell. This is because
            the cells divide to create new cells. This process is called cell division Gene expression 
            tells your body when and where to create new cells.

        Heredity is passing down traits or character from parents to offspring to the next 
        generation. A trait refers to
        (ex:black,blue,short,tall) (ex: eye color/ height) .
        recombination is shuffling the parents genes before passing them on to their offspring. Meaning that 
        eventhough siblings get half of their DNA from their father and their other half from their 
        mother, each child has a different combination.A set of alleles are homozygous if both alleles are both dominant or both recessive. A set
        of are heterozygous the set contains both a dominant and recessive allele.
        Recessive traits are only expressed when both alleles are recessive. If one allele 
        is dominant then the dominant trait will be expressed.
        Phenotypes are features that can be observed externally such as eye color. Whereas genotypes 
        are the genetic make up that can’t be observed. Can’t tell if being is homozygous or 
        heterozygous for a character. Also can be thought of as set of genes for a particular trait. (ex:TT / Tt)
        Phenotypic Ratio: (Tall : short)
        Genotypic Ratio: (TT: Tt: tt)
