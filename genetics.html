        <h2>How Are Organisms Created?</h2>
        <p>A body is composed of trillions of cells. Inside of a cell is a nucleus which contains
            chromatids. Chromatids are tangled and chromosomes are coiled chromatids in the 
            process of cell division. 
            Chromatids and chromosomes are similar, but are different names for different structures.
            Chromosomes are composed of genes which are made out of 
            deoxyriboNucleotide Acid (DNA). DNA is essentially a blueprint to creating organisms.
              From eye color to the number of appendages. DNA consists of a sequence of four 
              different blocks called nucleotides. The four types of nucleotides are Adenine(A), 
              Cytosine(C), Thymine(T), and Guanine(G). These are usually denoted as their 
              respective first letters. A only pairs with T and C only pairs with G. In a sequence of 
              nucleotides if there is variation we 
              call that variation a single nucleotide polymorphism (snps).  </p>

        <h2>Heredity</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -2rem;">Heredity is passing down traits from parents to their children. A trait is a genetic 
            characteristic about an individual such as eye color, height, and hair type.  Traits 
            are determined by genes. Even though siblings get half of their DNA from their father
             and the other half from their mother, each child has a different combination. This is
              because the parent’s genes are shuffled before they are passed down to their 
              children. This is called recombination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alleles are a form of genes and are used to predict traits. A set of alleles is 
            homozygous if both alleles are both dominant or both recessive. If a set of alleles 
            contains one dominant and one recessive allele then the set is heterozygous. Recessive
            traits are only expressed when both alleles are recessive. If even one allele is 
            dominant then the dominant trait will be expressed. </p>

        <h2>Genotype</h2>
        <p>Genotypes are the genetic make up that can’t be observed. Whereas phenotypes are 
            features that can be observed externally such as eye color. Genotyping is the process 
            of recording an individual's sequence of nucleotides at different locations.
