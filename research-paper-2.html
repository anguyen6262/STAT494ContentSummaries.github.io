            <h1>New approaches to population stratification in genome-wide association studies</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>To review the advantages and disadvantages of methods for correcting stratification and determine the optimal method under certain conditions.

                        Structured Association: Can accurately correct stratification in datasets whos 
                        population structure is the only type of sample structure. The data is grouped in 
                        different subpopulations.  Then the association statistics are computed. These steps are 
                        taken in software. Due to the large size of genome wide datasets these studies have high 
                        computational costs. However there is always new development of software to reduce these 
                        costs which would make structured association an excellent option for inferring population
                        structure and computing association statistics.fail to account for family structure or
                        cryptic relatedness

                        PCA primarily shows the effects of differential bias. It removes the confounding effect 
                        of when genotype isn’t associated with phenotype, but genotype and phenotype are both 
                        associated with ancestry. PCA creates a greater correction to data that have greater 
                        differences in allele frequencies. This makes sense because PC1 is created based on the 
                        greatest variance of the data points. Limitations include not modeling cryptic relatedness
                         and family structure. This can be improved by dividing by lambdaGC, but the test 
                         statistics that account specifically for family structure will still not be accurate. 
                         This also wouldn’t work if family structure is in the sample could potentially produce 
                         spurious principal components. This is due to the lack of variance in genetic ancestry. 
                         A solution to this problem is to use SNP loadings from a different sample in the same
                          study that does have family structure. This is only possible if the size of the dataset
                           is large enough. fail to account for family structure or cryptic relatedness. Another 
                           limitation is that it only accounts for fixed effects and doesn’t take into account the
                            relatedness of individuals. Variance can be because people are from different 
                            population structures(different genotypes, same family). People are still developing PCA to work for more studies.  Currently the main solutions is deleting or not including some data.

                        Family-Based Association tests: They are immune to stratification because the alleles 
                        have come from the same genetic ancestry. However the limitation is that information 
                        between family is required to calculate the test statistic.  One way to fix this 
                        limitation is to transform in between family information to a rank statistic then 
                        combining the results within family information. This ensures that the tests are 
                        completely immune to stratification.
