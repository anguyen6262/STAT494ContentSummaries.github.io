                    <li>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNP): genomic variant at a single base position in DNA.</li>
                    <li>Phenotypes: Features that can be observed externally. (ex: tall height)</li>
                    <li>Genotypes: Genetic make up that can’t be observed. Can’t tell if being is homozygous or heterozygous for a character. Also can be thought of as set of genes for a particular trait. </li>
                    <li>Homozygous: Same set of genes. Both dominant or both recessive.</li>
                    <li>Heterozygous: Different set of genes. Has both dominant and recessive alleles.</li>

                    The following study was written in 2007 and is still referenced today in the field of genetic Statistics. 
                    They sampled Caucuasian people in Europe. The reasoning for this sample is because it is easier to test 
                    people that are genetically similar. This can be controversial because the data and results can't be accuratly
                    applied to people with different ethnic backgrounds. The dataset is used for future studies because it is more cost effective to reuse datasets rather than 
                    collect new samples. They focused on seven different diseases and tested whether or not they were associated
                    with a SNPs. Descriptions of the seven diseases can be found below. <span><a href="">this</a></span>

        <li>Bipolar disorder : Episodes of extreme changes in mood, energy level, motivation, and interests.</li>
        <li>Coronary artery disease : damage or disease in the heart's blood vessels which can lead to heart attacks or chest pain.</li>
        <li>Crohn’s disease : Bowel disease that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
        </li>
