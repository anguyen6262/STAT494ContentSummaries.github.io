        <h1>Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this paper is to determine the genetic basis of seven different
                diseases. Genetic basis is how much variance in an individual’s DNA puts them at 
                risk for contracting a disease. Understanding the genetic basis for a disease can 
                potentially lead to new treatments of that disease. Brief descriptions of the 
                diseases are listed below.</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Bipolar disorder : Episodes of extreme changes in mood, energy level, motivation, and interests.</li>
                <li>Coronary artery disease : Damage or disease in the heart's blood vessels which can lead to heart attacks or chest pain.</li>
                <li>Crohn’s disease : Bowel disease that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.</li>
                <li>Hypertension : Also known as high blood pressure. This can lead to heart disease or strokes.</li>
                <li>Rheumatoid arthritis : Body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. Symptoms include swelling or inflammation of joints.</li>
                <li>Type 1 Diabetes: diagnosed in childhood. Symptoms include thirst, hunger, and fatigue because the body doesn’t produce enough insulin.</li>
                <li>Type 2 Diabetes: diagnosed in adult years. Symptoms include thirst, hunger, and fatigue because the body doesn’t produce enough insulin.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </section>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Aetiologies: cause of disease.</li>
            <li>Allelic architecture:# of distinct alleles that affect the likelihood of contracting a disease at a disease locus(location of a specific gene) and their frequencies.</li>
            <li>Allele frequency: Calculated by dividing the # of times the allele of interest is observed by the total number of alleles at that locus.</li>
            <li>Linkage: Closeness of genes or other DNA sequences to one another on the same chromosome.</li>
            <li>Linkage Disequilibrium: non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population.</li>
            <li>Covariates: independent variables that can affect outcome of trial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>The procedure for their experiment is closely similar to a GWAS procedure. 
            To summarize, the researchers gathered participants that are of
             European descent. They chose only one type of race because they wanted less sampling variation. 
             This is a standard practice, but it is controversial because the results can’t be 
             applied to people that are non-European. Then the researchers genotyped the 
             participants and collected the phenotype data. The phenotypes in this study 
             are the diseases. Then they conducted their hypothesis tests and created a Manhattan 
             plot and Quarter Quantile Plot.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <!-- <img src ="images\JC1QQ.jpg"> -->
        <p>
            The snps above the y=x line in this QQ plot have an association with the respective
            diseases. It seems that the none of snps in the sample size have an association with
            hypertension or bipolar disorder.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="images\JC1ManhattenPlot.png" alt=""> -->
        <p>
            The snps colored green in this Manhatten plot are the snps with an association with
            that disease. This graph also shows the researchers which chromosomes are likely to
            cause the individual to develop that disease. This information could potentially
            lead to new treatments.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            The information from this study is not applicable to people that are non-European.
