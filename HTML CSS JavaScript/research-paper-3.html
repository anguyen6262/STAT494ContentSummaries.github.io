  <h1>Genes mirror geography within Europe</h1>
  <p>
    If both grandparents originated from a single country, that country was used as the origin. If grandparents originated from different countries, then the individual was excluded. If info on grandparents was unavailable, then the individuals country of birth was used.
Sample does not include smaller genetically isolated populations such as basque or Orcadians. Large groups such as Swiss where split into categories such as Swiss-French, Swiss-German, Swiss-Italian. They were divided into these categories based on their primary language rather than their location.
